Project Background:
--------------------
The COVID-19 is an infectious disease which is affecting people all around the world since the begining of 2020. It has caused a devastating effect on both public health and global economy. To predict the whether a new COVID-19 patient would develop to death, and then allocate the proper medical resource to them will greatly save our limited medical resoures.

 Machine learning underpins many modern AI techniques, which can learn from data and give insight to us. The goal of this project is to explor different machine learning methods to predict the motality of COVID-19 patients.


Downloading the data:
-----------------------
The data to be used in this project is the CSV file named “COVID19_line_list_data.csv”  .There are two ways to download the data used in this project: 
1. Download directly from the website: https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset.
2. Alternatively, you can select the Download ZIP option under the Code option, it directly downloads all the files in a zip file format to your system. 


Softwares required:
--------------------
1. Anaconda3
2. Jupyter Notebook
